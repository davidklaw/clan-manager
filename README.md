Clan Manager
===
A long time ago, on Earth, I spent a lot of time playing semi-organized Counter-strike and wanted an easier way to manage match (team vs. team) data. From scratch, the Clan Manager was born.  With this tool players could…

   - Create, edit and remove players, matches, news, events and screenshots
   - Each resource had multiple attributes like player photo, name, and my favorite, computer specs
   - It had a polished UI that made doing all of this very easy
   - It featured snippets for use on your site frontend to pull data
   - It was probably some of the worst, most unsecure code I've ever written. I had never written an application before nor had I looked at the code of one outside of some early college classes.
   - I was a freshman in college… I think

The Experience
===
Building this was an incredible experience and even allowed me to try my hand at starting a business as I sold an encrypted version for a couple of bucks and would follow up with design services for Counter-strike teams. It was exhilerating but also frustrating to see as it started being passed around free of charge.

At one point I modified it to use as a CMS system for a local LAN-center and eventually discontinued work on it all-together.
